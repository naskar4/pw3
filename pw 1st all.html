     <ul>
<li>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</li>
<li>Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?</li>
<li>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."</li>
<li>Give a man a program, frustrate him for a day. Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime.</li>
<li>It's not at all important to get it right the first time. It's vitally important to get it right the last time.</li>
